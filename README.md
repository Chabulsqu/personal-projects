# Personal Projects
## This repository contains all the projects I made independently from any course

The projects here are mostly ideated by me or found in Websites like Front End Mentor or websites like that and are free to contribute, please note that each project has a Readme that explains its functionality/goal.
The projects, listed in chronological order, from older to newer: 
- [Testimonials Grid Section using CSS](/Testimonials/testimonials.html)
- [NFT Preview](/nft_preview/nft.html)

### How to access the projects
To run any project you can simply type https://chabulsqu.github.io/personal_projects in your web browser along with the relative path of the .html file of the project.
